<br/>
<p style= "margin-left:12%;">This is one of my favorite things to do with coffee is to make latter art, 
and this heart is my best pattern.</p>

<img height="11%" width="16%" src="../final/interst/11.jpg" alt="pour over coffee"style="float:left; margin-left:10px;  "/>
<br/>
<p style= "margin-left:12%;">What I like about 
pour over coffee is its acidity. A good acid will be accompanied 
by sweetness and also aroma. I think the acidity in coffee is good, not by the intensity of the acidity, 
but by the balance of acidity, sweetness and bitterness, and the quality of the acidity.</p>

<p style= "margin-left:12%;"><p style= "margin-left:12%;">This was one of my favorite sports before I came to the United States. In the past, 
my friends and I used to ride our bikes every Saturday morning to the suburban areas or to some local farms for delicious food. 
This photo is my personal first 238km race. </p>

<img height="11%" width="16%" src="../final/interst/13.jpg" alt="pour over coffee"style="float:left; margin-left:10px;  "/>
<br/>
<p style= "margin-left:12%;">I trained systematically before the race and ended up finishing fourth in the 
team competition. 
This was something I was very proud of, and I went on to compete in many other small and large races.</p>

<img height="14%" width="12%" src="../final/interst/10.jpg" alt="latter art"style="float:left; margin-left:10px;  "/>
<br/>
<p style= "margin-left:11%;">This is my favorite outdoor sport since I came to the U.S. 
It's also known as "water golf". I really like to use the road fishing method, the so-called road fishing method refers 
to the imitation of weak creatures to trigger the attack of large fish fishing method, fishing with artificial processing 
into mimic bait on the surface or water to imitate the movement or sound of insects, fish and other small animals to lure fish 
to feed or attack. This is what I caught in the sea in Vancouver, Canada. </p>

<!---   Game   --->
<h4 style= "margin-left:10%; color:#3c1053; font-size:27px;">Game</h4>
<p align="center">I sometimes play computer games in my free time. I especially like PUBG,
a FPS game, and I have a great interest in editing my highlights to make a video, 
which is how I often make videos with my friends to show each other.</p>
