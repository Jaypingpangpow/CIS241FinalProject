I really like CIS 241 Web Development 1. Although I am a beginner. 
I was so interested in it that I didn't even believe I could actually learn it. 
I was able to do most of the coding in HTML5, and Professor Lewis provided website 
to verify that the code was correct. Being able to use the validation site to make 
sure the code is validated as correct CSS or HTML5 will help me learn how to code 
correctly in the future. I believe there are tons of errors on my site that can now 
be cleaned up and corrected.

When I was trying to build my personal website, in the beginning,
 my head went blank and I couldn't get started at all. But I went over all 
 the lessons again and I gradually realized that building a website beforehand 
 is like writing an essay, you have to have a framework to know what you want to 
 do and how to do it. Although my website as a whole is almost all HTML content, I 
 also use CSS technology, and although I don't use much of it, my website looks 
 better because of the CSS.

The most annoying part of my weekly assignments along the
 way is the discussion groups, although they require at least 250 words 
 and at least 100 words to reply to others. I was very reluctant, but again, 
 I knew that Professor Louis had our best interest in mind. This is because we 
 will have to interview these questions when we face the interviewers when we apply
 for jobs in the future, and I am grateful to Professor Louis for providing us with 
 this link.

In the discussion group, I got a lot of enthusiastic responses from the 
students, and also together we discussed the problems we faced together, 
and more thankfully, our unstinting sharing out of videos and resources, and I 
thank everyone in this class.
