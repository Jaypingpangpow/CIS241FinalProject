		Hi, my name is Jiacong Zhou, you can call me Jay, because the name Jiacong is my Chinese name and many people have a hard time making the right pronounce, so they usually call me Jay.
</p>
<br/> 
<p>
	I am from a city in the Pearl River Delta in the south of China by the oncen.
	
</p>
<br/> 
<p>I've been in the US for two years ago, and the biggest obstacle for me is still the language problem, 
	but I believe I will master it.</p>
<br/> 	
<p>
	I would like to talk about myself and my interests.
</p>
<br>
<p> I am currently in school studying web design and web 
application development.</p>
<br>
<p>
 
 I want to learn it because it will get me a better job, the prerequisite is that I have to 
master it, and since I have absolutely zero knowledge of programming, it will be difficult for me at the moment.
</p>
<br/>
<p>I have three hobbies, and I am a <a href="interst.html" >coffee lover</a>, such as pour-over coffee and lattes, 
for which I have learned the art of lattes, and I also really like sports. Before I came to the United States, 
I used to <a href="interst.html">ride my bike</a> a lot, and participated in many competitions. After I came to America, I grew to love <a href="interst.html">fishing</a>. </p>
